# Template Module Interface

Status: Implemented

## Purpose

The Template module manages Conch Boot Indexes as containerd image records.
User-visible names are placed in a reserved record keyspace:

```text
logical:  registry.example:5000/team/busybox:latest
internal: io.conch.template/registry.example:5000/team/busybox:latest
```

The record target digest is exposed as the Template ID. Record updates and
content garbage collection follow normal containerd semantics.

## Domain Model

### Entry

| Field | Type | Description | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Name` | `string` | User-visible mutable logical Template Name. | Required. |
| `BootIndexDigest` | `string` | Current immutable Template ID and image-record target digest. | Required; valid OCI digest. |
| `Origin` | `Origin` | Process that produced the current target. | Required. |
| `BootMode` | `BootMode` | How the current target starts a Sandbox. | Required. |
| `ParentBootIndexDigest` | `string` | Parent ID for a checkpoint target. | Optional. |
| `SourceSandboxID` | `string` | Sandbox that produced a checkpoint target. | Optional. |
| `SourceRef` | `string` | Registry or rootfs source associated with the current target. | Optional. |
| `Labels` | `map[string]string` | Caller-defined, Name-scoped metadata. | Optional. |
| `CreatedAt` | `int64` | Time at which the Name record was first created. | Unix nanoseconds. |

`Origin`, lineage, provenance, and user labels describe the Name's current
target. They are replaced when the Name moves and are not retained as history.

#### Origin

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `image` | Built from an OCI rootfs image or pulled as a cold Boot Index. |
| `checkpoint` | Produced by checkpoint, or pulled as a resume Boot Index. |

#### BootMode

| Value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `cold` | Starts without saved memory state. |
| `resume` | Restores saved memory state. |

## Store Interface

```go
type Store interface {
    Put(context.Context, Entry, ocispec.Descriptor) (Entry, error)
    Get(context.Context, string) (Entry, error)
    List(context.Context, Filter) ([]Entry, error)
    Delete(context.Context, string) error
}
```

### Put

`Put` validates the Entry and Boot Index, then creates or updates the named
Template record. Updating one Name does not affect other Names.

### Get

`Get` resolves a Template Name, validates the image record schema, target digest
and metadata labels, and returns the current Entry.

### List

`List` enumerates image records carrying the Template schema label. Optional
`Origin` and `BootMode` filters apply to the current target metadata.

### Delete

`Delete` removes the named image record. It returns `ErrNotFound` when the Name
does not exist or when the record's target changes concurrently. Content
reclamation is asynchronous and follows normal containerd GC rules.
